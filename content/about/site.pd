# Motivations

Why do a new website?  Because the time is right.

## An online home for everything

I found I needed a home for my research

# Needs

What do I need this website to be able to do?

## Syntax highlighting

[Coderay](http://coderay.rubychan.de/ "Coderay - Fast and easy syntax highlighting for selected languages.")
or
[pygments](http://pygments.org/ "pygments - Python syntax highlighting")?

Coderay looks good, and has a nice, expressive Ruby syntax.
But it doesn't highlight `R` _or_ `vimscript`.
Pygments _does_ -- as well as [a whole lot more](http://pygments.org/languages/
"The ever-growing range of languages supported by pygments")!

I'm going with pygments.

### Problems with pandoc

I do all my writing in [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html
"Pandoc - a universal document converter").
It seems like the most flexible markdown superset that meets _all_ my needs:
blogging, scientific papers, and talk slides.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.vim .numberLines startFrom="3"}
let g:adjective = "flexible"
echom "I hear pandoc is pretty" g:adjective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, I see pandoc doesn't have support for `vim` highlighting.

```bash
for I in ls
do
  echo "$I"
done
```

```vim
let g:adjective = "flexible"
echom "I hear pandoc is pretty" g:adjective
```

$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i}$$ should work
