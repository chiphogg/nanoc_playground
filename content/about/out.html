--- title: About this website --- # Motivation Why do a new website? The time is right. ## An online home for everything I found I needed a home for my research # Needs What do I need this website to be able to do? ## Syntax highlighting [Coderay](http://coderay.rubychan.de/ &quot;Coderay - Fast and easy syntax highlighting for selected languages.&quot;) or [pygments](http://pygments.org/ &quot;pygments - Python syntax highlighting&quot;)? Coderay looks good, and has a nice, expressive Ruby syntax. But it doesn't highlight `R` _or_ `vimscript`. Pygments _does_ -- as well as [a whole lot more](http://pygments.org/languages/ &quot;The ever-growing range of languages supported by pygments&quot;)! I'm going with pygments. ### Problems with pandoc I do all my writing in [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html &quot;Pandoc - a universal document converter&quot;). It seems like the most flexible markdown superset that meets _all_ my needs: blogging, scientific papers, and talk slides. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.vim .numberLines startFrom=&quot;3&quot;} let g:adjective = &quot;flexible&quot; echom &quot;I hear pandoc is pretty&quot; g:adjective ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Okay, I see pandoc doesn't have support for `vim` highlighting. ```bash for I in ls do echo &quot;$I&quot; done ``` ```vim let g:adjective = &quot;flexible&quot; echom &quot;I hear pandoc is pretty&quot; g:adjective ``` $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i}$$
